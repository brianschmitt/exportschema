Export Schema
=============

Simple little console application which will export an Oracle Schema into separate files.

I needed a quick way to dump an entire schema. These files can then be used for schema compares, to (re)create a database, or for source control.

You may need to edit the App.config to specify the location of your tnsnames file.
